[![Page Object Model](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pattern-Page%20Object%20Model-important)](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-pom)

üåü **Modern Test Automation Suite Featuring:**
- üöÄ **Data-driven testing** with JSON test cases
- üß© **Page Object Model** architecture
- ‚ö° **Parallel test execution**
- üìä **Smart reporting** with screenshots and video
- üîÑ **Advanced error handling** with custom logging

## üß† Smart Architecture

### üìä Data-Driven Testing Engine
```typescript
// Test cases defined in clear JSON format
{
  testId: "TC1",
  title: "Implement user authentication",
  column: Column.TODO,
  tags: [Tag.FEATURE, Tag.HIGH_PRIORITY],
  project: Project.WEB
}
```
- **JSON-powered test cases** enable easy maintenance and scalability
- **Dynamic test generation** from data files reduces code duplication
- **Centralized test data** management for cross-team collaboration

### üèóÔ∏è Page Object Model (POM) Implementation
```typescript
// Example Page Object Class
class LoginPage {
  private readonly emailInput = this.page.getByTestId('email');
  private readonly passwordInput = this.page.getByTestId('password');

  async login(email: string, password: string) {
    await this.emailInput.fill(email);
    await this.passwordInput.fill(password);
    await this.page.getByTestId('submit').click();
  }
}
```
- **Reusable component library** reduces maintenance costs
- **Separation of concerns** between test logic and UI selectors
- **Type-safe interactions** with application elements

### ‚ö° Parallel Execution Power
```typescript
// Configure parallel execution
test.describe.configure({ mode: 'parallel' });
```

## üìà Advanced Features

### üîÑ Intelligent Error Handling
```typescript
// Custom error handler with automatic screenshots
async handleError(error: Error, context: string, options: ErrorOptions) {
  await this.page.screenshot({ path: `errors/${context}.png` });
  this.logger.error(`${context} Error: ${error.message}`);
  if (options.throwAfterHandle) throw error;
}
```
- **Automatic failure diagnostics** with screenshots
- **Contextual error logging** for faster debugging
- **Retry logic** for flaky test mitigation
- **Custom error types** for different failure scenarios

### üìä Actionable Reporting
![Test Report Example](https://example.com/report-screenshot.png)
- **HTML/JSON reports** with failure analysis
- **Video recordings** of test executions
- **CI/CD integration** ready

## üß™ Running Tests in Parallel
```bash
# Full parallel execution (default)
npm run testWindows
```


## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Highlights
**Key Stack Benefits:**
```
- **TypeScript** for type-safe test development
- **Playwright Fixtures** for test environment management
- **Custom Loggers** for execution transparency
- **CI-Ready** configuration with GitHub Actions support
```
